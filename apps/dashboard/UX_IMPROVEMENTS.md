## 🎬 Animations Details

### Page Load Animation
```typescript
container → Fades in all children with 0.1s stagger
item → Each component fades in with 20px upward motion
```

**Effect:** Components appear smoothly one after another instead of all at once.

### Hover Animations
```typescript
whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, y: -4 }}
```

**Effect:** Cards lift slightly and grow when you hover over them.

### Transition Timings
- **Duration:** 0.5s for smooth, not-too-fast animations
- **Easing:** Cubic bezier for natural motion
- **Stagger:** 0.1s delay between children

<div className="card-hover">

// Gradient text
<h1 className="gradient-text">
```
